                <p class="story">In Ukraine a spider web is assosiated with good fortune. The story behind the spider web on a Christmas tree is that a poor family grew a tree out of a pine cone. They did not have enough money to decorate it and from that a spiders spun their silk webs around the tree. The silk turned to silver and gold when the sun came up in the morning, leaving the family with a beautiful tree they could admire. This story is the reason why families in Ukraine decorate their trees with spider webs. Its a good luck charm.</p>

                <p class="story">Dead Horse Caroling is a tradition in Wales. What they do is carolers show up to your door hidden by a ribbon and bell-adorned sheet. They will be holding a real horse skill on a stick along with other carolers. They will sing to you, challenge you to a battle of rhyming insults and in return will be invited in for refreshments</p>
